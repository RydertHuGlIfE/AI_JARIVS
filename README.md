# AI_JARIVS

This is the second prototype in the step towards making the Real Life Jarvis 
The Model is currently being powered by the Gemini-AI Model Turbo 1.5 
This will provide upto 1.5 million tokens per day and about 200-300 word response per query [could be less havent been counted]

To launch either launch the gemini mark II or if you want to use the login system use GMII Launcher 
Passwords for this API is being stored in the credentials.json file 

[There is an even early android test build included using kivy so if someone wants to port the current project to the android port you're free to do so!]

There are a number of features included with this AI that you can review by looking at the code itself 

[there is another file that was for permanent conversation history]
The program did work but was bugging out after 10-20 responses and starts speaking the enitre chat history
